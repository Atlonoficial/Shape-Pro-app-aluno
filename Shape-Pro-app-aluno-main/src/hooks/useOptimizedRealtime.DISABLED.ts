 * DISABLED - This hook has been deprecated in favor of useRealtimeManager.ts
 * 
 * All realtime subscriptions should now use the centralized useRealtimeManager
 * which provides better connection pooling, debouncing, and resource management.
 * 
 * Migration: Replace useOptimizedRealtime with useRealtimeManager
 * 
 * @deprecated Use useRealtimeManager instead
